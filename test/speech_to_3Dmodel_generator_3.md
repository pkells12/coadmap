# Revised Development Roadmap: Text-to-3D Model Generation App

## Introduction

This roadmap outlines the development process for creating an application that converts textual descriptions into 3D model files suitable for 3D printing. The app prioritizes accessibility for users with no 3D printing experience while ensuring printable outputs through automatic validation and support generation.

Based on the specified requirements, this roadmap emphasizes:

- Minimized API costs through efficient implementation
- A focused MVP approach that prioritizes generation capabilities over editing features

## Phase 1: Project Foundations and Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 Development Environment Setup

#### 1.1.1 Backend Environment

For the backend, we'll use Python with FastAPI for improved performance and async support:

- Set up a Python virtual environment (Python 3.9+)
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn for the API server
- Install development tools: pylint, black, pytest
- Configure Git repository with branching strategy
- Establish project structure:
  ```
  /backend
    /api
    /services
      /text_processing
      /model_generation
      /optimization
    /models
    /utils
    /tests
    /config
  ```

For dependency management, use Poetry to precisely control package versions and create reproducible environments.

#### 1.1.2 Frontend Environment

For the frontend, we'll use React with Vite for improved build performance:

- Set up Node.js (v16+) environment
- Initialize a React project using Vite
- Install core dependencies:

- Secondary option: **Point-E** - OpenAI's open-source point cloud diffusion model
- Tertiary option: **DreamFusion** - Text-to-3D synthesis using 2D diffusion
- Consider huggingface hosted open-source models to reduce infrastructure costs

These models can be deployed on the server or as a separate microservice, with caching to reduce redundant processing.
